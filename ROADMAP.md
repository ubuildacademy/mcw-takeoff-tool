# Meridian Takeoff - Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Current Status: Production Environment
Version 2.0 - Production Deployment (November 2025)

### Infrastructure Updates
- ✅ Backend deployed to Railway (production environment)
- ✅ Frontend deployed to Vercel
- ✅ Database hosted on Supabase
- ✅ Environment configured for production workloads

## ✅ Completed Features

### Project Management
- Multi-user authentication and role-based access
- Project CRUD operations
- Project backup/restore system
- Grid/list view dashboard

### PDF Processing & Takeoff
- PDF upload and OCR processing
- Area, linear, volume, and count measurement tools
- ✅ Scale calibration for accurate measurements (fixed: viewport dimension consistency issue)
- Persistent measurements with cutout support
- Perimeter calculations
- Visual annotations (text, freehand, arrow, rectangle, circle)

### Conditions & Costing
- Custom takeoff conditions with color coding
- Material and equipment cost tracking
- Configurable waste factors
- Flexible unit systems (SF, SY, LF, CF, etc.)

### Reporting
- Excel export with multiple sheets
- PDF export with executive summary and visual overlays
- Cost analysis and breakdowns
- Executive summary reports

### AI & Search
- OCR text extraction from PDFs
- Full-text document search with highlighting
- AI chat integration with document context
- AI-powered sheet analysis and labeling

## 🚨 Known Issues & Bugs

### Critical (Remaining)
- [ ] **Page Rotation & Scaling**: When a page is rotated, scaling calculations are incorrect and takeoffs don't maintain proper position
- [ ] **Markup Position on Rotation**: Markups/measurements placed before rotating a page move to incorrect positions after rotation
- [ ] **Markup Drift on Zoom**: When zooming in/out, markups visually drift from their correct positions until selected (then they snap back). Measurements are stored correctly but rendering position is incorrect during zoom.

*Priority: Fix before adding new features*

## 🎯 Planned Features

### Phase 1: Advanced Features
- [ ] Bulk operations for conditions (multi-select, bulk edit)
- [ ] Template system for reusable condition sets
- [ ] Custom report templates and scheduling
- [ ] Enhanced mobile/tablet optimization

### Phase 2: AI Enhancement
- [ ] AI-powered measurement suggestions
- [ ] Smart condition detection and auto-assignment
- [ ] AI-assisted cost prediction
- [ ] Automated measurement validation

### Phase 3: Enterprise
- [ ] Real-time team collaboration
- [ ] Project versioning and change tracking
- [ ] Third-party software integrations (APIs)
- [ ] Advanced analytics and dashboards
