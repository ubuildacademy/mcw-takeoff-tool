in accordance with ASTM E119 and constructed in accordance with the requirements of the applicable UL Design Number (or
equivalent).2. Meets the requirements for structural integrity of exit enclosures and elevator hoist way enclosures for High-Rise Buildings (Section
403.2.3. of the 2012 and 2015 IBC) when installed in accordance with the abuse resistant assemblies listed on page two (2) of this
Assembly Evaluation Report (AER). Approved abuse resistant assemblies have been tested in accordance with ASTM C1629 andASTM E695.
Component Descriptions
1. J-RunnersUSG Shaft & Stair Wall Systems are generally constructed with the following components.
The metal framing members used in construction of USG Shaft & Stair Wall Systems are manufactured from cold roll-
formed light gauge galvanized steel conforming to ASTM A653 SS Grade 33 for 24ga thickness and ASTM A653 SS
Grade 40 for 20ga thickness. The galvanization coating shall be a G40 minimum. The available sizes are 2-1/2-in, 4-in
and 6-in deep and a length of 16-ft in 24 or 20 gauge. Position steel J-runners at floor and ceiling with the 1-in leg towards
the finished side of the wall. Securely attach the runners to the structure supports with power actuated fasteners.
For attachment to steel framed construction install floor and ceiling J-runners and End wall J-Runners or E-Studs, on
columns and beams before the steel is fireproofed, except where Z-Clips are used as in UL Design HW-D-0609.
2. Steel Studs
USG Steel C-H and E Studs are manufactured from cold roll-formed light gauge steel conforming to ASTM A653 SS
Grade 33 for 25ga thickness and ASTM A653 SS Grade 40 for 20ga thickness. The galvanization coating shall be a G40
minimum. The available sizes are 2-1/2-in, 4-in and 6-in deep and a length of 16-ft in 25 or 20 gauge.
Cut the C-H Studs 3/8-in to 5/8-in shorter than the floor-to-ceiling height. Install C-H Studs interlocked between the
SHEETROCK®
Brand Gypsum Liner Panels with the liner panels securely engaged.
Terminations: Install full length steel E-Studs or J-Runners vertically at T-Intersections, corners, door jambs and columns.
Openings: Frame with vertical E-Stud or J-Runner at vertical edges, horizontal J-runner at head or sill.Control Joints: Install full length steel E-Stud or J-Runner at edges of control joints, to fully support gypsum panels.C-H Studs: Based on stud size shown in Table 1 and Figure 7 of this AER.

Component Descriptions Continued3. Gypsum Liner Panels
Tested for Composite Limiting Heights Tables 2, 3, & 4:
SHEETROCK®
Brand Gypsum Liner Panels a high performance panel that is composed of a non-combustible gypsum
core encased in a water resistant 100% recycled green face and back paper. Gypsum Liner Panels are a nominal
thickness of 1-in x 24-in wide x 8-ft -- 14-ft long. Must meet the minimum requirements of ASTM C1396.
Alternatives for UL Fire Resistance:
SHEETROCK Brand Mold Tough™ Gypsum Liner Panels feature a non-combustible, moisture- and mold-resistant
gypsum core encased in moisture and mold-resistant, 100% recycled blue face and back papers. Available 1-in thick, 24-
in wide and in lengths up to 14-ft. Must meet the minimum requirements of ASTM C1396.
SHEETROCK Brand Glass-Mat Liner Panel have a noncombustible, moisture- and mold-resistant gypsum core that is
encased in moisture- and mold-resistant glass mat. Available 1-in thick, 24-in wide, and lengths up to 14-ft. Must meet
the minimum requirements of ASTM C1658.
Note: All of these panels should be cut 1-in shorter than the floor-to-ceiling height, to allow for the panel to be fittedbetween the top and bottom J-runners. Where shaft wall height exceeds the length of the liner panel; it must be butted
together with meeting factory end cuts. The joints should be staggered and positioned in the upper or lower 1/3 of the wall.
Panels must be UL/ULC classified for fire resistance and identified as Type SLX on the UL marking and UL Fire
Resistance Directory.
4. Gypsum Wallboard
Tested for Composite Limiting Heights Tables 2, 3, & 4:
SHEETROCK Brand FIRECODE C Core Gypsum Panels have been tested generate the shaft/stairwall limiting heights for
wall assemblies shown in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Panels are available in 1/2-in and 5/8-in thicknesses, 48-in wide and
lengths up to 14-ft. Product must be UL Classified for fire-rated construction (Type C) and meet the requirements of
ASTM C1396.
SHEETROCK Brand FIRECODE Core Gypsum Panels (Type X) have been tested generate the shaft/stairwall limiting
heights for the wall assembly described by Figure 6. Panels are available 5/8-in thick, 48-in or 54-in wide and lengths up
to 14-ft. Product must be UL Classified for fire-rated construction (Type SCX) and meet the requirements of ASTM
C1396.
Alternatives for UL Fire Resistance and/or Abuse Resistance:
SHEETROCK Brand Mold Tough Gypsum Panels, have a non-combustible, moisture- and mold-resistant gypsum core
encased in moisture- and mold-resistant, 100 percent recycled green face and brown back paper. Available in
FIRECODE and FIRECODE C core formulations in the same widths, thicknesses and lengths listed above. Product must
be UL Classified for fire-rated construction (Type C or Type SCX) and meet the requirements of ASTM C1396.
SHEETROCK Brand Mold Tough VHI (Very High Impact) Abuse Resistant Gypsum Panels have a non-combustible,
moisture-resistant core encased in moisture- and mold-resistant, 100 percent recycled green face and brown backpapers. A fiberglass reinforcing mesh is imbedded in the core adjacent to the back paper. Available in FIRECODE Core
formulation in the same widths, thicknesses, and lengths listed above. The panels have been tested for use in abuse
resistant assemblies in accordance with ASTM C 1629. Product must be UL Classified for fire-rated construction (Type
AR) and meet the requirements of ASTM C1278.
FIBEROCK®
Brand AR (Abuse-Resistant) Interior Panels (Type X) are high performance abuse resistant panels.
Available panels are 5/8-in thick x 48-in wide and available in lengths up to 12-ft. The panels have been tested for use in
abuse resistant assemblies in accordance with ASTM C 1629. Product must be UL Classified for fire-rated construction
(Type FRX-G) and meet the requirements of ASTM C1278.
Tested Abuse Resistant Assemblies:
1. Single layer of 5/8-in FIBEROCK VHI on 24-in o.c. 400CH20-34 Studs - Passed ASTM C1629 Hard Body Impact

1. See Figure 2 and 3 for vertical stud installation details within shaft/stair wall.
2. See Figure 6 for horizontal stud installation details within shaft/stair wall. The horizontal wall width is limited to the
length of the Gypsum Liner Panel and only 400CH20-34 and 600CH20-34 steel studs are permitted for horizontal studinstallations.
3. Tabulated limiting heights are based upon the tested composite behavior of the 2 hour wall assemblies described in
this AER only. Alternative designs are outside the scope of this AER.

AER-09038
Two-Hour Horizontal Gypsum Duct Enclosure, See Figure 10
1. A minimum 2-1/2-in deep 24 gauge J-runners attached horizontally to the perimeter or boundary wall, with power actuated fasteners.
Connection of the vertical C-H stud to the top J-runner and connection of the top J-runner to the structure shall be capable of carrying
the weight of the duct enclosure and verified by a registered design professional.
2. Apply three (3) layers of 1/2-in (minimum) SHEETROCK®
Brand FIRECODE®
C Core Gypsum Panels to the underside ""ceiling"" side of
the assembly. The base layer is attached with 1-in long Type S Screws that are spaced 24-in o.c. The second layer is attached with 1-
5/8-in long Type S screws that are spaced 12-in o.c., with all the joints staggered 24in o.c. from the base layer. The face layer isattached perpendicular to the C-H Studs with 2-in long Type S screws that are spaced 12-in o.c. and the joints are staggered 24-in o.c.
from the base layer.
3. Install the C-H studs perpendicular to the J-runners, spacing them 24-in o.c. with the C-section of the C-H stud facing downward
towards the corridor side of the assembly with two (2) screws a minimum of 1/2-in long Type S-12 screws, one on each end.4. 1-in thick SHEETROCK®
Brand Gypsum Liner Panel - Friction-fitted in ""H"" portion of C-H studs.
