- **AI Chat Integration**: AI assistant now has full access to document content
- **State Management**: Fixed infinite re-render loops and document synchronization
- **UI Improvements**: Fixed button layout issues in AI chat interface

#### Technical Achievements
- **Backend**: Implemented `pdf-parse` for efficient text extraction from vector PDFs
- **Database**: Supabase integration for storing and retrieving OCR results
- **Frontend**: Proper state management and component synchronization
- **Search**: Real-time search with confidence scoring and result highlighting
- **Performance**: Fast OCR processing with proper job tracking

### ðŸ”„ Current Development Priorities

#### Critical Priority Issues
- [ ] **Page Label Extraction**: Fix extraction of page labels from titleblocks - currently not working
  - Current Issue: "Extract Page Labels" feature shows "coming soon" alert
  - Need to fix: Implement actual page label extraction from configured titleblock areas
  - Impact: Users cannot automatically extract sheet numbers and names from drawings

- [ ] **Titleblock Configuration**: Fix the setup and configuration of where to look for titleblock information
  - Current Issue: Titleblock configuration dialog exists but doesn't properly save/apply settings
  - Need to fix: Save titleblock field coordinates, apply to OCR processing, and use for extraction
  - Impact: Users cannot define where sheet information is located on their drawings

#### High Priority Issues
- [ ] **Page Rotation Fix**: Takeoffs don't stay exactly where drawn when rotating pages
- [ ] **PDF Flickering**: Fix flickering PDF when drawing conditions
- [ ] **Markup Visibility**: Markups not visible across all zoom levels initially
- [ ] **PDF Report Rendering**: Fix PDF report generation to properly display graphic takeoff visualizations

#### Medium Priority Enhancements
- [ ] **OCR Enhancement**: Improve OCR accuracy with better highlights and fast navigation tab
- [ ] **Sheet Metadata Management**: Improve sheet data storage and retrieval system

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Notes

#### âœ… Completed OCR System Architecture
The OCR system has been successfully implemented and is fully functional:

1. **Backend OCR Service** (`/server/src/routes/ocr.ts` & `/server/src/services/simpleOcrService.ts`):
   - âœ… Uses `pdf-parse` for efficient text extraction from vector PDFs
   - âœ… Proper job tracking system with status monitoring
   - âœ… Correct document path resolution for uploaded files
   - âœ… Supabase database integration for storing OCR results
   - âœ… Search functionality with confidence scoring

2. **Frontend OCR Service** (`/src/services/apiService.ts` & `/src/services/serverOcrService.ts`):
   - âœ… Proper API integration with backend endpoints
   - âœ… Real-time job status tracking and completion handling
   - âœ… Integration with document state management
   - âœ… Search functionality with result highlighting

3. **Document State Management** (`/src/components/TakeoffWorkspace.tsx` & `/src/components/SheetSidebar.tsx`):
   - âœ… Proper OCR status checking and document flagging
   - âœ… State synchronization between components
   - âœ… OCR completion handling and document updates

4. **Search Integration** (`/src/components/SearchTab.tsx`):
   - âœ… Full-text search across OCR-processed documents
   - âœ… Result highlighting with confidence scores
   - âœ… Page navigation from search results

5. **AI Chat Integration** (`/src/components/ChatTab.tsx`):
   - âœ… AI assistant with access to document content
   - âœ… Project context building with OCR data
   - âœ… Chat management (export/clear) with proper UI layout

#### Remaining OCR-Related Tasks
1. **Titleblock Configuration**: Save and apply titleblock field coordinates for targeted extraction
2. **Page Label Extraction**: Use configured titleblock areas for automatic sheet number/name extraction
3. **OCR Enhancement**: Improve accuracy with better text recognition and formatting
