# Meridian Takeoff - Development Roadmap

## Current Status
**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Version**: Development Build  
**Commit**: Latest - Dual canvas system fixes completed but introduced regressions
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL REGRESSIONS** - PDF disappearing at zoom levels, measurements on wrong pages

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Dual Canvas Implementation Issues ðŸ”´ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED - REGRESSIONS OCCURRED**
**Problem**: Recent dual canvas system implementation had introduced new issues
**Impact**: PDF viewer functionality was compromised, with new regressions appearing
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **PARTIALLY FIXED** - Core issues resolved but regressions introduced
**Issues Fixed**:
- âœ… Canvas synchronization during zoom/scale changes
- âœ… Coordinate system inconsistencies between PDF and annotation layers  
- âœ… Measurement loading timing issues
- âœ… Rendering race conditions between PDF and annotation canvases
- âœ… Canvas positioning and overlay alignment
- âœ… Memory leak prevention and cleanup
**New Regressions Introduced**:
- ðŸ”´ **PDF disappearing at certain zoom levels** (60%, 70%, etc.) - floating-point precision issues
- ðŸ”´ **Takeoffs appearing on all pages** - measurement filtering broken again
- ðŸ”´ **Canvas dimension sync warnings** - annotation canvas out of sync
**Root Cause**: Floating-point precision in PDF.js viewport calculations causing canvas dimension mismatches

### 2. Current Regressions (Post-Dual Canvas Fixes) ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL PRIORITY**
**Problem**: Fixing dual canvas issues introduced new regressions
**Impact**: Core functionality broken - PDF disappearing and measurements on wrong pages
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **ACTIVE REGRESSIONS** - Need immediate attention
**Issues**:
- ðŸ”´ **PDF Disappearing at Zoom Levels**: PDF becomes invisible at 60%, 70%, and other specific zoom levels
  - **Symptoms**: White canvas area, no PDF content visible
  - **Console**: "Annotation canvas dimensions out of sync, forcing update" warnings
  - **Root Cause**: Floating-point precision in PDF.js viewport calculations (e.g., 2116.7999999999997 vs 2117)
- ðŸ”´ **Measurements Appearing on All Pages**: Takeoffs show on every page instead of just the page they were created on
  - **Symptoms**: 4 measurements visible on page 1, same measurements appear on other pages
  - **Console**: "RENDERING: 4 measurements" on all pages
  - **Root Cause**: Measurement filtering by page number not working correctly
**Immediate Action Required**:
- Fix floating-point precision in canvas dimension calculations
- Restore proper page-based measurement filtering
- Ensure canvas synchronization works at all zoom levels

### 3. Phantom Lines Issue ðŸ”´ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Problem**: When drawing measurements, phantom lines appear before clicking to start the measurement
**Impact**: Poor user experience, confusing visual feedback
**Root Cause**: Likely related to the PDF flickering fix implementation
**Status**: May be resolved by dual canvas system, needs testing
**Investigation Needed**:
- Test if dual canvas system resolves phantom lines
- Verify `renderCurrentMeasurement` function logic
- Check `isMeasuring` state management
- Test coordinate transformation accuracy

### 3. Takeoffs Not Displaying on Page Load ðŸ”´ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Problem**: Existing measurements don't appear immediately when loading a page
**Impact**: Users can't see their work until they create a new measurement
**Root Cause**: Timing issue between PDF loading and measurement rendering
**Status**: May be resolved by dual canvas system, needs testing
**Investigation Needed**:
- Test if dual canvas system resolves measurement loading
- Verify `renderAnnotations` function execution order
- Check measurement loading sequence in `PDFViewer.tsx`
- Test with different PDF sizes and loading speeds

### 4. PDF Not Clearing Takeoffs on Condition Deletion ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Problem**: When deleting a condition, measurements remain visible on PDF until page refresh
**Impact**: Confusing state where deleted measurements still appear
**Root Cause**: Client-side state not properly syncing with server-side deletion
**Status**: Unchanged by dual canvas implementation
**Investigation Needed**:
- Verify `takeoffMeasurements` dependency in PDFViewer useEffect
- Check if `renderAnnotations` is being called after condition deletion
- Test the reactive update mechanism

## Dual Canvas System - Detailed Issues to Fix

### 5. Canvas Synchronization Issues ðŸ”´ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Problem**: PDF and annotation canvases may not stay perfectly synchronized
**Impact**: Measurements could appear misaligned or at wrong positions
**Status**: Partially addressed, needs testing
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test canvas alignment during zoom operations
- [ ] Verify both canvases update dimensions together
- [ ] Test with different PDF sizes and aspect ratios
- [ ] Fix any misalignment issues found

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test coordinate conversion accuracy
- [ ] Verify mouse click positioning
- [ ] Test measurement rendering accuracy
- [ ] Fix any coordinate mismatches found

### 7. Measurement Loading Timing Issues ðŸ”´ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Problem**: Annotations might render before PDF is fully loaded
**Impact**: Measurements could appear in wrong positions or not at all
**Status**: Partially addressed, needs testing
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test measurement display on page load
- [ ] Verify timing between PDF rendering and annotation rendering
- [ ] Test with slow-loading PDFs
- [ ] Fix any timing issues found

### 8. Rendering Race Conditions ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Problem**: Multiple useEffect hooks could cause rendering conflicts
**Impact**: Annotations might flicker or not render consistently
**Status**: Partially addressed, needs testing
**Tasks**:

- [ ] Verify perfect overlay of annotation canvas on PDF canvas
- [ ] Test with different browser zoom levels
- [ ] Fix any positioning issues found

### 10. Memory Leak Prevention ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
