### ðŸ”„ Current Development Priorities

#### Critical Priority Issues
- [x] **Ollama Server Migration**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Successfully migrated to Ollama Cloud
  - âœ… **Achievement**: AI chat now uses Ollama Cloud models instead of local installation
  - âœ… **Implementation**: Updated `ollamaService.ts` to connect to Ollama Cloud via backend proxy
  - âœ… **Impact**: Users no longer need to install/configure Ollama locally, centralized cloud hosting
  - âœ… **Technical**: Backend proxy handles CORS and API key security, frontend connects seamlessly
  - âœ… **Models Available**: Access to multiple cloud models (gpt-oss:120b, kimi-k2:1t, qwen3-coder:480b, deepseek-v3.1:671b, gpt-oss:20b)
  - âœ… **Admin Panel**: Model selection and configuration available in admin settings


#### High Priority Issues
- [ ] **Page Rotation Fix**: Takeoffs don't stay exactly where drawn when rotating pages
- [ ] **PDF Flickering**: Fix flickering PDF when drawing conditions
- [ ] **Markup Visibility**: Markups not visible across all zoom levels initially

#### Medium Priority Enhancements
- [ ] **OCR Enhancement**: Improve OCR accuracy with better highlights and fast navigation tab
- [ ] **Sheet Metadata Management**: Improve sheet data storage and retrieval system
- [ ] **Project Specifications Viewer**: Add dedicated specs upload and AI analysis section for each job - allows users to upload project specifications (PDFs, documents) and have AI interpret them to provide project details, requirements, and insights without cluttering the takeoff workspace. Features would include:
  - Specs upload and organization per project
  - AI-powered document analysis and interpretation
  - Searchable project requirements and details
  - Viewer-only interface separate from takeoff workspace
  - Integration with existing AI chat for spec-related questions

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Notes

#### âœ… OCR System Status: Fully Functional
The complete OCR system is operational with:
- **Document Processing**: Full OCR with job tracking and result storage
- **Search Integration**: Full-text search with result highlighting and page navigation
- **AI Chat Integration**: AI assistant with access to document content and project context
- **Training System**: Advanced pattern recognition, character substitution, and learning from corrections
- **Admin Panel**: Comprehensive interface for managing OCR training and statistics
- **Titleblock Extraction**: Working with manual field selection and OCR processing

#### Future AI Enhancements
- **Automatic Scale Detection**: Recognize dimension strings and extract scale information from drawings
- **Element Recognition**: Identify takeoff-relevant elements (walls, rooms, doors, windows)
- **AI Takeoff Automation**: Leverage existing OCR training system for automated takeoff generation

#### âœ… Ollama Server Migration - COMPLETED
**Goal**: Move from local Ollama installation to server-side hosting
- âœ… **Achieved**: Migrated to Ollama Cloud with backend proxy architecture
- âœ… **Implementation**: Frontend connects to backend proxy, which handles Ollama Cloud API calls
- âœ… **Security**: API keys stored securely on backend, CORS issues resolved
- âœ… **User Experience**: No local installation required, seamless cloud-based AI chat
- âœ… **Model Management**: Admin panel provides model selection and configuration
- âœ… **Testing**: AI chat fully functional with OCR content analysis capabilities
