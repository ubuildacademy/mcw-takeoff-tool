### ðŸ”„ Current Development Priorities

#### Critical Priority Issues
- [ ] **OCR Processing Fix**: OCR is not running properly - needs complete overhaul of OCR service integration
  - Current Issue: OCR requests are sent but processing doesn't complete successfully
  - Need to fix: Backend OCR service integration, job status tracking, and result handling
  - Impact: Users cannot extract text from PDF pages for search and analysis

- [ ] **Page Label Extraction**: Fix extraction of page labels from titleblocks - currently not working
  - Current Issue: "Extract Page Labels" feature shows "coming soon" alert
  - Need to fix: Implement actual page label extraction from configured titleblock areas
  - Impact: Users cannot automatically extract sheet numbers and names from drawings

- [ ] **Titleblock Configuration**: Fix the setup and configuration of where to look for titleblock information
  - Current Issue: Titleblock configuration dialog exists but doesn't properly save/apply settings
  - Need to fix: Save titleblock field coordinates, apply to OCR processing, and use for extraction
  - Impact: Users cannot define where sheet information is located on their drawings

- [ ] **OCR Service Integration**: Resolve API endpoint mismatches and service communication issues
  - Current Issue: Frontend OCR service calls don't match backend API expectations
  - Need to fix: Align API endpoints, parameter formats, and response handling
  - Impact: OCR functionality is completely broken

#### High Priority Issues
- [ ] **Page Rotation Fix**: Takeoffs don't stay exactly where drawn when rotating pages
- [ ] **PDF Flickering**: Fix flickering PDF when drawing conditions
- [ ] **Markup Visibility**: Markups not visible across all zoom levels initially
- [ ] **PDF Report Rendering**: Fix PDF report generation to properly display graphic takeoff visualizations

#### Medium Priority Enhancements
- [ ] **OCR Enhancement**: Improve OCR accuracy with better highlights and fast navigation tab
- [ ] **Sheet Metadata Management**: Improve sheet data storage and retrieval system

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Notes

#### OCR System Architecture Issues
The current OCR implementation has several critical problems:

1. **Backend OCR Service** (`/server/src/routes/ocr.ts`):
   - Uses Tesseract.js for OCR processing
   - Has job tracking system but frontend doesn't properly integrate with it
   - Document path resolution may be incorrect for uploaded files

2. **Frontend OCR Service** (`/src/services/ocrService.ts`):
   - API calls don't match backend expectations
   - Missing proper job status polling
   - No integration with sheet metadata system

3. **Titleblock Configuration** (`/src/components/TitleblockConfigDialog.tsx`):
   - Dialog exists but configuration isn't properly saved to database
   - No integration with OCR processing to use configured areas
   - Missing validation and error handling

4. **Sheet Metadata System** (`/server/src/routes/sheets.ts`):
   - Basic CRUD operations exist but OCR integration is incomplete
   - Missing proper storage of extracted text and metadata
   - No connection between OCR results and sheet data

#### Required Fixes
1. **Fix OCR API Integration**: Align frontend service calls with backend API
2. **Implement Job Status Tracking**: Add proper polling for OCR job completion
3. **Fix Titleblock Configuration**: Save and apply titleblock field coordinates
4. **Implement Page Label Extraction**: Use configured titleblock areas for text extraction
5. **Connect OCR Results to Sheet Data**: Store extracted text in sheet metadata
