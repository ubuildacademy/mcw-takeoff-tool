  - âœ… **Admin Features**: Admin panel with user invitation system, role management, and user oversight
  - âœ… **User Features**: Individual user accounts with profile management and project creation
  - âœ… **Data Security**: Complete data isolation - users only see their own projects, admins see all projects
  - âœ… **Authentication Flow**: Landing page â†’ Login â†’ Project list â†’ Project workspace with proper navigation
  - âœ… **Backend Integration**: All API endpoints updated with authentication and authorization middleware
  - âœ… **Data Migration**: Existing project data preserved and properly assigned to admin user
  - âœ… **Field Transformation**: Backend API responses transformed from snake_case to camelCase for frontend compatibility

- [x] **Ollama Server Migration**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Successfully migrated to Ollama Cloud
  - âœ… **Achievement**: AI chat now uses Ollama Cloud models instead of local installation
  - âœ… **Implementation**: Updated `ollamaService.ts` to connect to Ollama Cloud via backend proxy
  - âœ… **Impact**: Users no longer need to install/configure Ollama locally, centralized cloud hosting
  - âœ… **Technical**: Backend proxy handles CORS and API key security, frontend connects seamlessly
  - âœ… **Models Available**: Access to multiple cloud models (gpt-oss:120b, kimi-k2:1t, qwen3-coder:480b, deepseek-v3.1:671b, gpt-oss:20b)
  - âœ… **Admin Panel**: Model selection and configuration available in admin settings


#### High Priority Issues
- [ ] **Page Rotation Fix**: Takeoffs don't stay exactly where drawn when rotating pages
- [ ] **PDF Flickering**: Fix flickering PDF when drawing conditions
- [ ] **Markup Visibility**: Markups not visible across all zoom levels initially

#### Medium Priority Enhancements
- [ ] **OCR Enhancement**: Improve OCR accuracy with better highlights and fast navigation tab
- [ ] **Sheet Metadata Management**: Improve sheet data storage and retrieval system
- [ ] **Project Specifications Viewer**: Add dedicated specs upload and AI analysis section for each job - allows users to upload project specifications (PDFs, documents) and have AI interpret them to provide project details, requirements, and insights without cluttering the takeoff workspace. Features would include:
  - Specs upload and organization per project
  - AI-powered document analysis and interpretation
  - Searchable project requirements and details
  - Viewer-only interface separate from takeoff workspace
  - Integration with existing AI chat for spec-related questions

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Notes
