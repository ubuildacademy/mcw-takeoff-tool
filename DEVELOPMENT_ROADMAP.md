### Area Measurement Behavior Fix (Latest) ✅
**Problem**: Area measurements were auto-completing after 3 points instead of allowing unlimited vertices until double-click completion.

**Root Cause**: Area measurement logic had hardcoded auto-completion after 3 points, inconsistent with volume measurement behavior.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Removed Auto-Completion Logic**: Eliminated hardcoded 3-point completion for area measurements
2. **Enhanced Double-Click Handler**: Updated `handleDoubleClick` to properly complete both area and volume measurements
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Area measurements now behave identically to volume measurements
4. **User Control**: Users can now add unlimited vertices and double-click to complete the shape

**Technical Details**:
- Area measurements now chain vertices continuously until double-click
- Double-click completion works for both area and volume measurement types
- Maintains existing measurement storage and rendering systems
- Follows industry standards for professional takeoff software

### Page Overlay Synchronization Fix ✅
**Problem**: Takeoffs would disappear when returning to a page until zoom level was changed, which forced a re-render.

**Root Cause**: SVG overlay was not properly re-initialized when returning to a page, causing stale DOM state.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Page-scoped SVG Overlay**: Added stable keys (`overlay-${currentPage}-${fileId}`) to force proper re-mounting
2. **Dedicated Page Visibility Handler**: Created `onPageShown()` function that explicitly initializes overlay when page becomes visible
3. **Separated Navigation from Zoom**: Added dedicated effect for page changes that doesn't depend on zoom events
4. **Consistent Overlay Initialization**: Both PDF rendering and page navigation use same overlay initialization routine

**Technical Details**:
- SVG overlay now has correct viewport dimensions and viewBox set on every page show
- `onPageShown(pageNum, viewport)` ensures overlay is properly sized and markups are re-rendered
- Page navigation triggers overlay re-initialization immediately, not just on zoom
- Maintains existing page-based markup system (`markupsByPage`) for proper isolation

### PDF Horizontal Scrolling Fix ✅
**Problem**: Users could not scroll to the leftmost edge of PDFs due to canvas centering constraints that prevented proper horizontal scrolling.

**Root Cause**: PDF canvas was being centered horizontally (`justify-center`) which created a negative offset that prevented access to the leftmost portion of the PDF content.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Fixed Container Layout**: Changed PDF container from `justify-center` to `justify-start` to align canvas to left edge
2. **Improved Scrolling Range**: Canvas now properly positioned to allow full horizontal scroll range
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can now access all areas of the PDF, including leftmost edges

**Technical Details**:
- Changed `flex justify-center` to `flex justify-start` in PDF viewer container
- Canvas offset changed from -707.5px (hidden) to +24px (visible) when scrollLeft = 0
- Horizontal scroll range increased from 600px to 1223px for better PDF navigation
- Maintains vertical scrolling functionality while fixing horizontal constraints

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Architecture Validation Testing**:
   - Test measurement accuracy across all zoom levels (25% to 300%)
   - Verify SVG overlay alignment with PDF canvas at all scales
   - Test measurement persistence and loading across page navigation
   - Validate coordinate precision with high-DPI displays
   - Test performance with large PDFs and many measurements

2. **Professional Feature Testing**:
   - Test calibration accuracy with known distances

   - Test with various PDF types and sizes
   - Validate cross-browser compatibility
   - Test with different device pixel ratios
   
3. **Performance & Stability Testing**:
   - Test memory usage over extended sessions
   - Test with multiple PDF loads and page navigation
   - Test rendering performance with 100+ measurements
   - Test error handling and recovery
   - Test concurrent user operations
