  - Current Issue: AI chat requires users to install and run Ollama locally (`ollama serve`)
  - Need to implement: Server-side Ollama installation with model management
  - Impact: Users won't need to install/configure Ollama locally, centralized model hosting
  - Technical: Update `ollamaService.ts` to connect to server Ollama instance, add server model management

- [ ] **Backend Titleblock Extraction**: Complete the backend implementation for titleblock extraction
  - Current Issue: Frontend titleblock extraction works, but backend endpoint returns mock data
  - Need to fix: Implement actual OCR processing in `/sheets/:documentId/extract-sheet-info` endpoint
  - Impact: Titleblock extraction results are not properly saved to database
  - Technical: Update `server/src/routes/sheets.ts` to use actual OCR processing

#### High Priority Issues
- [ ] **Page Rotation Fix**: Takeoffs don't stay exactly where drawn when rotating pages
- [ ] **PDF Flickering**: Fix flickering PDF when drawing conditions
- [ ] **Markup Visibility**: Markups not visible across all zoom levels initially
- [ ] **PDF Report Rendering**: Fix PDF report generation to properly display graphic takeoff visualizations

#### Medium Priority Enhancements
- [ ] **OCR Enhancement**: Improve OCR accuracy with better highlights and fast navigation tab
- [ ] **Sheet Metadata Management**: Improve sheet data storage and retrieval system
- [ ] **Project Specifications Viewer**: Add dedicated specs upload and AI analysis section for each job - allows users to upload project specifications (PDFs, documents) and have AI interpret them to provide project details, requirements, and insights without cluttering the takeoff workspace. Features would include:
  - Specs upload and organization per project
  - AI-powered document analysis and interpretation
  - Searchable project requirements and details
  - Viewer-only interface separate from takeoff workspace
