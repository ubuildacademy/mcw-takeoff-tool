### ðŸ”„ Current Development Priorities

#### Critical Priority Issues
- [ ] **Ollama Server Migration**: Move Ollama from local user installation to server-side hosting
  - Current Issue: AI chat requires users to install and run Ollama locally (`ollama serve`)
  - Need to implement: Server-side Ollama installation with model management
  - Impact: Users won't need to install/configure Ollama locally, centralized model hosting
  - Technical: Update `ollamaService.ts` to connect to server Ollama instance, add server model management


#### High Priority Issues
- [ ] **Page Rotation Fix**: Takeoffs don't stay exactly where drawn when rotating pages
- [ ] **PDF Flickering**: Fix flickering PDF when drawing conditions
- [ ] **Markup Visibility**: Markups not visible across all zoom levels initially

#### Medium Priority Enhancements
- [ ] **OCR Enhancement**: Improve OCR accuracy with better highlights and fast navigation tab
- [ ] **Sheet Metadata Management**: Improve sheet data storage and retrieval system
- [ ] **Project Specifications Viewer**: Add dedicated specs upload and AI analysis section for each job - allows users to upload project specifications (PDFs, documents) and have AI interpret them to provide project details, requirements, and insights without cluttering the takeoff workspace. Features would include:
  - Specs upload and organization per project
  - AI-powered document analysis and interpretation
  - Searchable project requirements and details
  - Viewer-only interface separate from takeoff workspace
  - Integration with existing AI chat for spec-related questions

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Notes

#### âœ… OCR System Status: Fully Functional
The complete OCR system is operational with:
- **Document Processing**: Full OCR with job tracking and result storage
- **Search Integration**: Full-text search with result highlighting and page navigation
- **AI Chat Integration**: AI assistant with access to document content and project context
- **Training System**: Advanced pattern recognition, character substitution, and learning from corrections
- **Admin Panel**: Comprehensive interface for managing OCR training and statistics
- **Titleblock Extraction**: Working with manual field selection and OCR processing

#### Future AI Enhancements
- **Automatic Scale Detection**: Recognize dimension strings and extract scale information from drawings
- **Element Recognition**: Identify takeoff-relevant elements (walls, rooms, doors, windows)
- **AI Takeoff Automation**: Leverage existing OCR training system for automated takeoff generation

#### Ollama Server Migration
**Goal**: Move from local Ollama installation to server-side hosting
- Install Ollama on server with model management
- Update frontend to connect to server Ollama instance
- Eliminate local installation requirements for users

### ðŸ“‹ Development Process

#### Bug Tracking
Issues are tracked in this document and addressed based on priority and user impact.

#### Feature Development
New features are developed following industry standards for construction takeoff software, focusing on:
- Professional accuracy and precision
- User-friendly interface design
- Efficient workflow optimization
- Reliable data management

#### Quality Assurance
All features undergo thorough testing before deployment to ensure:
- Measurement accuracy
- Data integrity
- User experience quality
- Performance optimization

## ðŸš€ Future Vision

### AI-Powered Takeoff Automation
**Goal**: Leverage the existing OCR training system and measurement data to develop AI models that can automatically perform takeoffs with human-level accuracy.

**Foundation**: The current system provides excellent groundwork with:
- Rich training data collection (measurements, scale calibration, OCR results)
- Structured data storage with precise PDF coordinates
- Advanced OCR training system for pattern recognition
- Comprehensive condition and measurement management

**Next Steps**: Focus on scale detection enhancement and element recognition to build toward automated takeoff generation.
